<h2 class="oneline">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>Iceland is the home of the Saga, a form of
literature which includes the telling of the story
of a hero&rsquo;s life and adventures in a fixed, regular
form, and which is usually intended for recitation,
though the Saga is never set in the customary versified
style of poetry. A large number of these Sagas,
relating to Iceland, Greenland, North America, and
the Norse countries, still remain, and among them
the Frithiof Saga, narrating the stirring adventures
of that hero of the Northland and Viking of its seas,
is one of the most beautiful. Its subject is noble,
heroic, and free from exaggerated description or
overwrought sentiment. Frithiof is a splendid type
of the old Norse hero, invincible in battle upon the
land, fearless of Nature&rsquo;s wrath as he sails the seas in
his dragon ship, impulsive yet just, swift in punishment
yet quick in forgiveness. The central motives
of the Saga are his love for King Bele&rsquo;s daughter,
Ingeborg; the refusal of her brothers to sanction
their marriage because the hero is not of royal
birth; her unwilling marriage to the old King Ring;
Frithiof&rsquo;s exile, and his final union with Ingeborg
after the death of her husband and reconciliation
with her brother. Interwoven with the narrative
itself, which is full of dramatic situations, are some
of the old myths, than which none is more beautiful
than the death of the gentle god Balder. The very
breath of the North sweeps through the stately story
which the German author has told with so much
skill. Those who wish to come in closer contact
with the Saga itself can do so by consulting Bishop
Tegner&rsquo;s masterly translation.</p>

<p>In olden times there ruled in Norway a King of
great renown called Bele, whose wife died early,
leaving him two sons and a daughter. When
the latter had reached her sixth year, the King
said to Thorsten, his brother-in-arms and lifelong
friend, &ldquo;My rosebud, Ingeborg, is the joy of my
heart, but none the less I must send her away and
entrust her to the guardianship of Hilding the Wise,
so that, far from the turmoil and distractions of a
court, the light of true knowledge shall be hers. But
lest she should miss the companionship of her beloved
playfellow, I pray thee permit thy son Frithiof to
accompany her, that they may be reared together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly will I do so,&rdquo; replied Thorsten; &ldquo;not
alone to honor thy request, but because I know thou
hast my son&rsquo;s welfare also at heart in sending him as
the companion of thine own child to be taught by
the wise Hilding. My King&rsquo;s will shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Hilding&rsquo;s abode lay on the sea-coast, surrounded
by gardens and wooded hills, and there Ingeborg
and Frithiof spent the years of their childhood,
faithfully taught and cared for by the good old
man. Two rare blossoms of the Northland were
these children, both richly endowed with gifts of
mind and body: Ingeborg was like the swelling
rosebud within whose heart the promise of the
spring lies dreaming, while Frithiof grew up tall
and strong as a young oak tree crowned with its
crest of rustling leaves. So blessed by the gods
were they with health and beauty that never had
their like been seen in all the North. Now listening
to the wondrous tales of their wise master, with clear
eyes uplifted to his; now racing over the sunny
meadows or dancing lightly under the dark boughs of
the fir trees in the silvery moonlight, they were like
the Light Fairies, whose appearance betokens blessing
and fills the heart with anticipations of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Frithiof was but little older than Ingeborg, and
when he first learned from Hilding to read the Runic
signs, it was his delight to teach them in turn to
his beloved playmate. Ofttimes they would sail out
upon the wind-tossed sea, and when the shifting of
the sail sent foam and spray dashing into the
boat, Ingeborg would clap her small hands in glee.
No tree was too high for the bold lad when he
wished to capture a nest of young birds for the
King&rsquo;s child; even the osprey&rsquo;s eyrie, high among
the rocky crags, was not safe from his daring
quest. &rsquo;Twas he that found for her the first pale
blossoms of the springtime, the first ripe strawberry,
the summer&rsquo;s first golden ear of corn. Joyously
they wandered together in the forest, Frithiof
armed to protect his playmate in case of need; for
he early strove to train himself in all a hero&rsquo;s duties.</p>
<p>Thus, like a beautiful dream, the happy days of
childhood glided by. Ingeborg blossomed into
maidenhood, and Frithiof became a stalwart youth.
The King&rsquo;s daughter spent more time in her
own chamber now, learning the tasks of women,
chief of which was the weaving of garments, while
Frithiof was often abroad with the men in quest of
game or booty. Inheriting not only his father&rsquo;s
strength and daring, but also his discretion and
cheerfulness, he was beloved by all and soon aroused
the wonder of his companions in the chase by
the boldness with which he would attack the
fiercest beasts, felling them with a blow from his
spiky club, or piercing them through with the
sharp-pronged spear. As in earlier days he had been
wont to bring his playmate gifts of flowers or fruit
as greetings of the season, so now he laid at her feet
the trophies of his prowess&mdash;shaggy bears or grisly
wild boars, often revealing upon his body bloody
traces of the struggle. Admiringly Ingeborg&rsquo;s gaze
would rest at such times on the young hero, while
her heart beat fast in terror for his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>And when on cold winter nights they sat together
in the great hall by the blazing hearth fire listening
to the legends old Hilding told them of the gods,
or, when the King&rsquo;s daughter would sing of the
deeds of some great hero long at rest beneath his
grassy mound, she seemed to Frithiof like a goddess
sent by the great All-Father for a brief space to the
darksome earth to awaken a foretaste of Valhalla&rsquo;s
delights. &ldquo;Praises of Frigga&rsquo;s golden hair are sung
throughout the land,&rdquo; he would say to himself,
&ldquo;but surely it can be no more beautiful than
Ingeborg&rsquo;s fair tresses.&rdquo; And when he gazed into
those soft eyes, so full of heaven&rsquo;s own light and
hue, he doubted Hilding&rsquo;s declaration that the eyes
of the goddess Frigga were the most beautiful in all
the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Death of Balder</span></h2>
<p>Again the Spring had come. Frigga, the
radiant Earth-goddess, had decked meadow,
hill, and vale with bloom and verdure,
and summoned the various warblers of
grove and wood. One mild evening Ingeborg and
Frithiof repaired with Hilding to a hillside overlooking
the sea and seated themselves on the mossy
stones. There, while the waves roared at their feet,
the master told them of the gentle god Balder, and
how envy and malice brought him to his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Balder was a son of the all-powerful Odin and
the fair Earth-goddess Frigga, beautiful as the day
and so bright that a shining splendor surrounded
him as he traversed the dome of heaven on his white
steed, swifter than thought. All evil, hatred, and
strife were abhorrent to him. Eloquent, wise, mild,
and just, he ever sought to promote peace, to avert
misfortune, and to ease pain and sorrow. Sometimes,
assuming human shape, he would mingle in
the combat, but never, even in the heat of battle,
did he lift his sword against a mortal. Though the
other gods often took part in the strife of men, &rsquo;twas
to do good alone that drew Balder to the field of
battle. Once on a hot summer&rsquo;s day it chanced
some warriors were perishing for want of water;
whereupon he thrust his spear into the ground, and
a cool spring gushed forth, while others welled up
wherever his horse&rsquo;s hoofs had trodden. These
springs were inexhaustible and still exist, surrounded
by sacred groves, wherein the beneficent god will
be worshipped to the end of time. Equally gentle
and lovely was his spouse Nanna, and far above the
clouds, whither the eye of man cannot penetrate,
they dwelt in their palace, Silvery Lustre, where
nothing evil or impure can ever enter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Balder was beloved by all the gods and goddesses
save only Loke, the ever-evil, who hated him.
One night Balder dreamed that some danger threatened
his life, and so alarming was this dream that
he could not shake off its shadow, but sad and heavy-hearted,
thought only of approaching evil. Sorrow
seized not only upon Nanna, his loving wife, but
upon all the gods and goddesses, when they learned
of the dark forebodings that filled Balder&rsquo;s soul.
In vain did Odin, his father, spend many days and
nights in thought; in vain did he take counsel with
the other gods and consult his two wise ravens, who
see into the past and future, as to the nature of the
danger that threatened his beloved son. At last he
determined to undertake the perilous journey to the
abode of the goddesses of Fate. Rising from his
shining throne, he left the palace, mounted his fire-breathing
celestial steed that stood before the door,
and, followed by the two ravens and the two wolves
who are his constant companions, flew like lightning
through the space betwixt heaven and earth
and soon reached the path that leads to the kingdom
of the pale goddess, Hel, in the terrible underworld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far down below Valhalla, the golden palace of
the gods, whither heroes are borne by Odin&rsquo;s battle-maidens,
the Valkyrs, on their winged steeds, lies
the dread realm of shadows where abides the inexorable
Hel. Loke is her father; her mother&mdash;the
giantess Angurboda, is a sister of the frightful wolf
Fenris and the earth-enveloping serpent. Woe,
thrice woe to him who descends into the cold mist-kingdom
of the goddess of death! Misery is her
Hall, Ruin her Threshold, Pining Sickness her Bed,
and Danger the Curtains thereof. Sloth is her
Thrall, and Despair her Handmaiden. She eats
from the Dish Hunger with the Knife of Famine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;To this terrible place Odin now took his way.
The path, which no living man had ever trodden,
led between frightful abysses and icy crags. But he
heeded not these terrors nor the furious yelping and
snapping of the death-hounds, intent only on learning
what evil threatened his favorite son. At last
he reached the spot where dwelt the goddesses of
Fate, and at the first gray Rune-stone he swung
himself from his steed. Below it had lain for a
thousand years the Norn who reads the future;
while about the desolate tomb the wind moaned
through the leafless branches and whirled aloft the
parching sand. Odin drew his sword and inscribed
thrice with it a Runic sentence in the sand. Then
he shouted thrice the Runic call which, uttered by
the lips of a god, has power to wake the dead within
their graves. In dull, hollow tones a voice answered
from the depths:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What mystic spell of sternest might</p>
<p class="t0">Penetrates the dungeon&rsquo;s night?</p>
<p class="t0">Stirs me from my sleep of old?</p>
<p class="t0">Who art thou, O stranger bold?</p>
<p class="t0">Go! let me rest, for here below</p>
<p class="t0">Through Winter&rsquo;s snows and Summer&rsquo;s glow,</p>
<p class="t0">Through dripping dew and streaming rain,</p>
<p class="t0">A thousand years I now have lain.</p>
<p class="t0">Ruthless thou stirrest the dead&rsquo;s deep rest&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Who mayst thou be, thou stranger guest?</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Odin answered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A wanderer I, unknown my name;</p>
<p class="t0">A warrior&rsquo;s son, untold my fame;</p>
<p class="t0">Of the upper world I would not know,</p>
<p class="t0">But fain would seek of those below.</p>
<p class="t0">For whom is the glittering table spread?</p>
<p class="t0">For whom prepared the golden bed?</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Again the hollow tones responded:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sawest thou not in beaker bright</p>
<p class="t0">Draught of sweet mead, foaming light?</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er it hangs the golden shield</p>
<p class="t0">Warrior&rsquo;s arm no more shall wield!</p>
<p class="t0">Balder&rsquo;s coming these betoken;</p>
<p class="t0">Balder&rsquo;s death doom hath been spoken!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This rede reluctant have I told&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Now get thee gone, thou stranger bold.</p>
<p class="t0">Leave the weary to her rest</p>
<p class="t0">And come no more, whate&rsquo;er thy quest.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down in the abyss the mists rolled and parted,
permitting Odin for an instant to gaze into the joyless
realm of death, and he saw that all was indeed
made ready to receive his beloved son. With the
tears starting to his eyes he mounted his steed and
turned sadly homeward. Loud cries of woe broke
from the waiting gods and goddesses when Odin
told them the saying of the Norn. Vainly they
sought some means by which the doom of their
favorite might be averted, till at last Frigga bethought
her of a plan, which was hailed with joy
by all. As mistress of the earth, she bound by
oath everything that existed thereon, fire and water,
iron and all the other metals, rock and soil, bush
and tree, all disease or poison, with all created beings
of the earth, the air, and the water,&mdash;not to
harm her son. Alone of the tender mistletoe that
hangs from the bough, she took no oath, for from
that she feared nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Deeming their favorite safe from harm, the gods
in their joy began to sport with him. Some flung
sharp-pointed spears at him, and lo! they fell harmless
to the ground. Others smote his uncovered
head with their keen blades, yet not a hair of his
head was injured. Bright and laughing as a fair
spring morning, the god stood in their midst, catching
the hissing darts and lances in his hands.
Their joyous cries at last reached the ears of Loke,
whose only pleasure it was to awaken strife and discontent
within the hearts of gods and men, and he
hastened thither to blight, if it might be, these
heaven-born flowers of joy. Taking the form of
an aged dame with a staff in her trembling hand,
he approached the goddess Frigga, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me, I pray thee, O watchful Earth-mother,
wherefore the gods are glad, so that I may
share their joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frigga replied: &lsquo;All nature has sworn to me to
do no harm to my son Balder. His life was in
great peril, but now shall the Norn&rsquo;s rede be
brought to naught, nor shall he descend into the
kingdom of pale Hel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Loke asked: &lsquo;Didst thou take oath of everything
upon the earth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Frigga answered: &lsquo;Of all save the tender
mistletoe that grows east of Valhalla: from that
surely there is naught to fear.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now was Loke rejoiced, for mistletoe causes
the death of the tree from which it draws its life.
Slipping softly out from the gates of Valhalla, he
hastened to where it grew, and, breaking it off,
fashioned from the tough stem a dart which he
sharpened to the keenest point. Then, as the old
woman, he again joined the circle of the gods still
busy with their sports. Perceiving H&ouml;der, the
blind god, who stood apart listening to his companion&rsquo;s
joyous cries but unable to share their
sports, he drew near and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why dost thou too not hurl the spear or
speed the dart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas! How can I?&rsquo; replied H&ouml;der. &lsquo;Were
not the light gone from my eyes, gladly would I
also do honor to Balder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, then, that thou shalt,&rsquo; said Loke.
&lsquo;Take thy bow and this dart; I will guide its
flight for thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&ouml;der did as he was bid, and down sank Balder
lifeless to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;This was the greatest misfortune which had ever
befallen the gods in Valhalla. For a space they
stood horror-stricken, gazing at the corpse of the
gentle god. Then the vaulted halls echoed to
their cries of woe. Beyond all words was their
grief and anguish. At length they bethought them
to seek the author of the evil deed; but vengeance
was beyond their power, for Odin&rsquo;s palace is a sanctuary.
Moreover, Loke had vanished. With sighs
and lamentations they bore the beloved dead to the
seashore, where, drawn up on rollers, stood Balder&rsquo;s
ship. On this his body was to be burned. But all
the efforts of the gods were powerless to stir the
mighty vessel from its place; whereupon they summoned
the giantess Hyrrocken (Fire Whirlwind) to
their aid. A rushing sound was heard as she came
with streaming hair, riding a great wolf bridled with
a serpent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laying her mighty hands upon the ship she
pushed it into the sea with such force that sparks flew
from the rollers. Seized with rage and chagrin at
this, Thor lifted his hammer to shatter the head of
the witch, but the other gods hastened to pacify him,
and then a fresh misfortune befell. The heart of
Balder&rsquo;s blooming wife Nanna burst with its load of
sorrow, and she sank lifeless into the arms of Frigga.
The bodies of the youthful pair thus united by
death were laid upon the funeral pyre that had been
raised within the ship, and consumed amid the
lamentations of all the gods. This is the story of
Balder&rsquo;s death, which brought sorrow and mourning
into Odin&rsquo;s halls of joy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>With rapture Ingeborg and Frithiof had listened
to old Hilding&rsquo;s tale, while far in the distance they
heard the rumbling of Thor&rsquo;s chariot, in which the
God of Thunder rides upon the clouds, and saw
the flickering lights that follow the blows of his
hammer. Tears glistened in Ingeborg&rsquo;s eyes, and
even Frithiof&rsquo;s heart was moved. Presently they
arose and turned their faces homeward. Ingeborg
retired to her chamber, while Frithiof and Hilding
seated themselves on cushions before a table upon
which burned a taper.</p>
<p>Suddenly Frithiof spoke: &ldquo;Terrible indeed must be
the abode of the goddess Hel; yet gladly would I die
and descend thither could I but know that Ingeborg
would mourn for me as Nanna mourned for Balder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilding was amazed at this speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can it be that thou
art cherishing a love for Ingeborg? Never can it
bring thee happiness. Bethink thee! King Bele&rsquo;s
ancestors are descended from the gods, while thou
art but the son of a yeoman. From the sons of
princes will Bele choose a son-in-law, nor mayst
thou ever hope to wed his child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Frithiof laughed and his eyes flashed as he answered,
&ldquo;The gods take no heed of rank. With
them valor is all. They will spurn him who fails
in courage, even though he be of their own blood;
but him who strives with all his soul to imitate
them in godlike deeds they will hold in honor.
The fame I have already won for myself by slaying
the beasts of the forest shall count as much for me as
if my ancestral line stretched up to Odin&rsquo;s halls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas for this love of thine!&rdquo; cried Hilding.
&ldquo;I fear me &rsquo;twill bear thee naught but thorns.
My old eyes were dim that I saw not what mischief
was brewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, father, say not so!&rdquo; answered Frithiof.
&ldquo;Never till this day have I thought to win Ingeborg
for my wife. &rsquo;Tis but now my heart hath revealed
its yearnings for her and her alone in all the
world. But I swear to thee by all the gods that
never shall her image be banished thence. If need
be, my sword shall be my wooer. Aye! I would
contend for her with the Thunder-God himself; nor
will I give her up so long as life shall last. Yet of
this I will say naught to her father, but sue for her
in due form after the manner of our forefathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Frithiof thus spoke, Ingeborg sat in her chamber,
her thoughts also busy with him. In his form
she seemed to see the fair young god Balder, and
prayed the gods to guard the noble youth and grant
him fame and honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">King Bele and Thorsten</span></h2>
<p>King Bele and Thorsten, his faithful
old brother-in-arms, were now bowed with
the weight of years, like two ruined
temples upon whose walls are graven
runes of wisdom still powerful to stir the hearts of
reverent beholders.</p>
<p>One day the King said to Thorsten: &ldquo;My friend,
the evening of life draws on; no longer has the
mead its wonted flavor, and heavy grows the helm
upon my weary head. The world grows dim before
my eyes, but clear and bright toward me
streams the light of Valhalla. Therefore I have
summoned our sons hither. As we have ever
stood fast by each other, so it is my wish that
they should do. With this and other matters I
would charge the young eagles ere my lips are
sealed by death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The three youths soon entered the royal hall,
Helge, the eldest first. Pale and gloomy of countenance
was he, as if the terrors of the death-kingdom
had set their seal upon him. With
blood-stained hands, fresh from the sacrificial grove
he came, for he was wont to tarry there, communing
with seers and soothsayers. Behind him followed
Halfdan, his brother, whose bright locks framed a
face noble, indeed, of feature but weak and effeminate
in expression. The sword at his side seemed
worn but in jest, and he looked like some fair maid
who had sportively donned the garb of a hero.
Last came Frithiof, a blue mantle hanging from his
shoulders and taller by a head than his companions.
As the three stood before the King, it was like the
bright noonday between rosy morn and dusky night.</p>
<p>Then the King began: &ldquo;My end is nigh, O sons,
wherefore I charge ye, govern the land in harmony;
for union is like the lance-ring, without which the
strength of the lance is lost. Let force stand guard
before the country&rsquo;s gate; but within its boundaries
cherish the holy blossoms of peace. Lift not your
swords save against the foe. Let your shields be the
safeguard of the peasant&rsquo;s home. A foolish prince
is he who oppresses his own people; for as their
strength is, so is his own. The leafy crown of a tree
whose sapless trunk is rooted in bare rock soon
withers. Four pillars of stone support the dome
of heaven; the throne rests only upon one, the law.
Woe to the land where violence reigns; for thereby
shall both ruler and people perish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;The gods, O Helge, do indeed dwell in temples,
but not in them alone. So far as voice can reach,
so far as the sun&rsquo;s golden beams can penetrate, or
the thoughts of man can fly, so wide are the halls of
their boundless sanctuaries. The blood of sacrificial
victims oft deceives; runes, howsoever deeply graven,
sometimes prove false; but upon a just and upright
heart, O Helge, Odin hath inscribed runes which
god and man may trust. As flowers adorn the brazen
shield, so doth gentleness become strength. It
is not Winter, but balmy Spring, that opens the bud
of life. Make to yourself true friends! A friendless
chief, be he ever so mighty, is like a tree whose
bark has been stripped away by storms; but he who
is blessed with true friendship is like the forest giant,
shielded from tempests by the companions that surround
it. Boast not of thy ancestors&rsquo; deeds and
honors. What avails the heritage of a mighty bow
which thou hast neither the strength nor the skill
to bend? The fame of thy sires rests with them in
the grave: in its own waves the rushing stream
flows onward to the sea!&rdquo; Then turning to his
second son the King continued: &ldquo;Thou too, O
Halfdan, hear my words and treasure them in thy
heart. A pleasant wit is the adornment of the wise;
but idle chatter befits none, least of all a prince&rsquo;s son.
Honey is sweet; but without hops no mead can be
brewed. Put steel into thy sword, Halfdan, and
earnestness into thy play! Never yet lived there
man who knew too much, however famed for wisdom;
but countless is the number of those who
know too little. Disregarded at the feast sits the
fool who holds the seat of honor by right of birth
alone; &rsquo;tis to the wise man the guests lend ear,
however lowly be his seat. Choose not every man
to be thy blood-brother: an empty house stands
open to all who pass; the rich man&rsquo;s door is barred.
Entrust thy confidence to but one; what is known
to three is known to all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The old King ceased, and Thorsten arose. &ldquo;To
permit thee, King Bele, to wander alone through
Odin&rsquo;s halls, befits not one who hath ever been thy
comrade upon earth. Together we have shared life&rsquo;s
changes, and in death methinks we shall not be
parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to Frithiof his son, he said: &ldquo;The years
have whispered many a counsel in my ear for thee,
my son. As Odin&rsquo;s birds hover about the burial
mound, so do the teachings of experience linger on
the lips of age. This above all else lay thou to
heart: honor the gods. From them alone spring
all blessing and prosperity, even as it is they who
send the storm-wind and the life-giving sun-rays.
They gaze into the heart&rsquo;s most secret depths,
whither no man&rsquo;s eye can penetrate. Avoid evil:
long years must oft do penance for one hour&rsquo;s sin.
Obey the King: one must be lord over all if the
land would prosper; the night hath many lights;
the day but one; willingly should the better man do
homage to the best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;One handle only hath the sword; he who grasps
it elsewhere wounds his hand. Strength is a gift of
the gods; but without judgment, force is of small
avail. The bear has the strength of twelve men, yet
he is slain by one. Against the sword-thrust hold
the shield; against violence, the law. Guard thy
heart from pride; few are moved to fear thereby, but
all to hate. The more arrogant thou growest, the
nearer is thy fall. Many have I seen soar high,
who now must go on crutches. Praise not the day
before its end, the mead before &rsquo;tis drunk, nor the
counsel before &rsquo;tis proved. Youth is prone to trust
the lightest word; but battle tests the value of a
blade, and friendship is tried by need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trust neither the ice of a night nor the snows of
Spring. It is true of all men that strength of body
and mind must pass away, but the fame of an upright
man lives on forever. Therefore, O my son,
resolve only what is noble, do only what is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake the aged heroes, whose sage warnings are
still passed from mouth to mouth in the Northland.
They further charged their sons to perpetuate the
friendship that had bound them together, through
life, in weal and woe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ever back to back we stood when danger
threatened,&rdquo; said King Bele, &ldquo;and if it came still
closer, then with one shield we met it. Hold fast
together as one man, ye three, and never shall the
Northland see your overmatch; for strength bound
to kingly rank and power is like the steel rim that
encircles the shield of gold. Fail not to greet for
me my fair rose Ingeborg, who in peace and quiet
hath bloomed as becomes a royal maiden. Shield
her well with brotherly love and loyalty, that no
rude tempest bear away my tender flower. Be
thou a father to her, Helge; guard her as your own
child, yet forget not that harsh constraint will oft revolt
a noble heart, which by gentleness may easily
be guided in the path of virtue and of custom.
Let our weary bodies be laid to rest beneath two
grave-mounds, on either side of the stream, that its
rushing waters may chant for us eternal praises of
the heroes. Oft at the midnight hour, when the
pale moon sheds her silvery splendors and the cooling
dews descend upon our mounds, shall thou and
I, my Thorsten, discourse of olden days across the
flood, and our voices will mingle with the murmuring
of the waves. And now, dear sons, farewell!
farewell! Leave us in peace, that far from the
court we may prepare ourselves to enter into the
glories of Valhalla.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Inheritance</span></h2>
<p>The two aged heroes died as they had
hoped, within a short time of each other,
and were buried as King Bele had bidden,
the two princes being declared joint heirs
to the throne by decree of the people; while Frithiof
took possession of his heritage, Framn&auml;s. His lands
were on the coast, and extended for three miles in
each direction. Forests of birch crowned the mountain
tops, whose slopes were covered with golden
barley and waving rye, growing to the height of
a man. Lakes teeming with fish mirrored the
wooded heights. Through the forests, threaded
with rushing streams, roamed noble stags, proud
and stately as kings. On the rich meadows herds
of cattle with sleek glossy hides cropped the green
sward; while here and there roved flocks of sheep,
like fleecy cloudlets slowly drifting across the blue
vault of heaven. Ranged in two rows, twelve pairs
of fiery coursers pawed impatiently in their stalls;
shod with shining steel were their hoofs, their manes
knotted with red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The great drinking-hall was so spacious that six
hundred guests would scarcely fill it. Round the
wall extended a table of polished oak, and on either
side of the high-seat images of the gods were skilfully
carved from elm wood, one representing the
All-Father Odin, the other Frey, who rules over the
rain and sunshine. Over the high-seat where Thorsten
had sat for so many years a glossy black bearskin,
with scarlet jaws and the claws tipped with
silver, was thrown. Midway of the hall was the
great hearth of smoothly polished stone, whence the
dancing flames shot ceaselessly upward; and suspended
around the walls, helm and shield and sword
glittered in the reflection of the blaze. Rich indeed
was the dwelling: abundance everywhere met the
eye,&mdash;crowded presses, well-filled cellars and store-rooms;
while many a jewel, spoil of many a conquest,
lay hidden in close-locked chests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>But the three most precious possessions of the
house were famed throughout the land. Of these the
first was a sword, called Angurvadel, or Brother of
Lightning. Forged by dwarfs in some far Eastern
land, Frithiof&rsquo;s ancestors had wrought with it many
heroic deeds. The hilt was of hammered gold, and
the blade was covered with strange runes, the meaning
of which was unknown save to those who forged it
in the distant Orient. When Frithiof drew it from
the sheath, it flashed like the lightning or the
streaming Northern Lights. Moreover, a magic
power belonged to this wondrous heirloom: so long
as peace ruled the land the runes on the blade gleamed
dull and pale, but when war prevailed they burned
red as the comb of a fighting cock.</p>
<p>Next to this sword in renown was an arm-ring of
pure gold, the work of halting Vaunlund, the Vulcan
of the North. Graved on it were the names of the
holy gods and their castles, with the signs of the
changing seasons, while crowning the circlet, as the
sun crowns the heavens, was a splendid ruby. This
ring had long been an heirloom of the house and had
once been stolen by the robber Sote, who roved the
seas pillaging and destroying. News came at last
to Thorsten that Sote had caused himself to be buried
with all his treasures in a walled-up mound on the
shores of Britain; yet there his spirit found no rest,
but haunted the place as a spectre. Forthwith Thorsten
resolved to seek this ghostly visitant, and with
Bele, who offered to accompany him, took ship and
sailed away to the shore of Britain, where they soon
found Sote&rsquo;s place of burial. Like a sunken palace
was the grave-mound, over which lay piled up vast
heaps of earth and ruined stonework. Thorsten
and Bele peered through a chink of the doorway
into the vaulted depths. There stood the black
viking ship, and high up on the mast squatted a
grisly shape wrapped in a blue flaming mantle, its
staring eyeballs rolling, while it vainly endeavored to
scour the blood stains from a rusty sword. All about
lay heaps of gold, and on the arm of the phantom
gleamed Thorsten&rsquo;s precious heirloom, the stolen
arm-ring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Bele whispered to Thorsten, &ldquo;Let us go down
together and fight with this fiery spectre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But half angrily Thorsten answered, &ldquo;Nay, one
against one was the custom of our fathers; alone will
I strive with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long they contended as to which should first encounter
that ghastly foe, but the lot fell to Thorsten.
One blow of his spear burst in the door, and he descended
into the vault, while, shield before him and
sword in hand, King Bele listened without. Wild
chantings he heard at first, like some magic spell,
then loud clashing sounds, as of swords crossed in
conflict. Then came a horrible scream, followed by
instant silence, and out staggered Thorsten, pale and
distraught; but on his arm he bore the ring. Never
in after days would he relate what had passed in
those awful depths, and when questioned would turn
away shuddering. But he was often wont to say,
&ldquo;Truly, &rsquo;twas dearly bought, this arm-ring. But
once in my life have I trembled, and that was when
I took it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Last of the three family treasures was the good
ship &ldquo;Ellida.&rdquo; Frithiof&rsquo;s ancestor, Wiking, so it
was said, returning once from a foray, discovered on
his own shores a shipwrecked man. Tall he looked
and nobly formed, with an open countenance, whose
expression was constantly changing like the glancing
of waves in the sunlight. Sea-green floated his hair,
white as wave-foam his beard. A blue mantle enveloped
his form, and the golden belt he wore was
set with corals. Steering directly to the spot, Wiking
rescued the unfortunate, took him to his home,
and feasted him right nobly. But when at night
the stranger was offered a bed he shook his head,
smiling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fair is the wind and my ship a good one,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and many a mile I hope to leave behind me
ere the break of day. Naught but thanks have I
to offer thee in return for thy hospitality, for my
wealth lies deep beneath the ocean wave. Yet in
the morning it may be thou wilt find some gift from
me upon the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At daybreak Wiking hastened to the shore, and
lo! with the swiftness of the sea-eagle darting upon
its prey there came flying into the haven one of the
warships commonly known as dragons. Not a soul
was to be seen on board, neither steersman nor rowers;
yet unerringly the rudder guided its winding
course amid rocks and shoals. As it neared the land,
the sails furled themselves, the anchor fell, and the
slender vessel rested quietly upon the sandy beach.
As Wiking stood gazing in astonishment at all this,
voices sounded from the dancing waves. They
chanted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The man thou didst rescue and shelter</p>
<p class="t0">Was &AElig;gir, the lord of the sea;</p>
<p class="t0">He forgets not his debt. See&mdash;yon dragon</p>
<p class="t0">He sendeth as token to thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Royal, indeed, was the gift of the sea-god. The
solid beams of the ship were not joined in the usual
way, but grown together. Long and dragon-shaped
it lay upon the water, the head reared high, wide
jaws gleaming red with gold, the body speckled with
blue and gold, and ending at the rudder in a coiling
tail covered with silver scales. Black were the sails,
with edgings of gold, and when each was full stretched,
the ship flew like the storm wind, swifter than the
sea-eagle.</p>
<p>With all these treasures and more besides, Frithiof,
next to the two kings, was the richest man in all the
land. Kingly of nature was he, if not by birth, and
gentle and noble in word and deed. Twelve mighty
champions had he ever beside him, tried comrades
of his dead father. Among these graybeards, like
a rose set in a wreath of withered leaves, was a youth
called Bj&ouml;rn, joyous as a child, yet with the strength
of manhood and the wisdom of age. Frithiof had
grown up with him, and together they had sworn
blood-brotherhood.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully amid these heroes sat Frithiof in the
high-seat draining the mead horn at his father&rsquo;s
grave-feast, after the custom of his ancestors, while
with a heavy heart he listened to the thundering
hero-songs sounded in praise of the departed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Wooing</span></h2>
<p>Each day the great hall echoed to the
sound of harpstrings and rang with
praises of the great deeds of his sires, but
naught could rouse Frithiof from his melancholy.
Once more the Spring awoke with smiles;
the blue sea was flecked with swelling sails of ships,
and still his gloom remained unbroken. His
thoughts ever dwelt on the happy days at Hilding&rsquo;s
abode, when the King&rsquo;s child was his beloved companion.</p>
<p>At last Bj&ouml;rn went to him and said: &ldquo;Why does
Frithiof sit like a wounded eagle in its eyrie?
What is amiss with thee, my friend? Surely thou
hast no lack of lands or goods; song and harp
sound for thee by night and day; the mead horn
passes from hand to hand. But vainly thy good
steed stamps in his stall; vainly the hooded falcon
screams for prey. See how &lsquo;Ellida&rsquo; strains at her
cable and spreads her wings, impatient to be free!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Then Frithiof clasped his friend&rsquo;s hand and,
shaking off his sorrow, embarked with his comrades
in the dragon, which was soon speeding onward
through the foaming waves.</p>
<p>Helge and Halfdan were sitting on their father&rsquo;s
grave-mound near the sea, holding judgment for
the people, when &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; approached. Frithiof
landed with his men and, entering the circle of warriors,
thus addressed the two kings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stand here before ye, O Kings! as suitor for
the hand of Ingeborg. Surely your dead father
would have smiled upon our union, since &rsquo;twas by
his wish that we grew up together under Hilding&rsquo;s
guidance, like two saplings with branches intertwined,
whose tops Frigga winds about with silver thread.
Of no royal race am I, &rsquo;tis true, but the fame of
my sires is ofttimes sung in royal halls, as well
ye know. Easily might I win for myself a
kingdom and wear the golden circlet on my brow;
but &rsquo;tis my choice rather to dwell in the land of
my birth, my sword ever ready to defend the throne
or the hut of the poor. On King Bele&rsquo;s mound
we stand; in the depths below he heareth and
speaketh for me&mdash;&lsquo;Join ye the hands of Frithiof
and Ingeborg!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Frowning darkly, Helge rose and scornfully replied:
&ldquo;Not for a peasant&rsquo;s son is our sister destined;
none but a prince may hope to win her.
Thou art called the mightiest hero in all the Northland;
let that content thy pride, and aspire not to
the hand of a maiden whose forefathers sprung from
Odin himself. My kingdom needs not thy service;
that shall be our own care. But if thou wouldst
have a place at court among my hired warriors,
that I will not deny thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frithiof laughed grimly. &ldquo;I be thy vassal?
Nay&mdash;I am a man for myself, even as was my
father. Out, Angurvadel, from thy sheath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bright flashed the blade in the sunlight, the runes
glowing fiery red. &ldquo;Now, Angurvadel, let us see
if any shall deny that thou at least art high-born
and noble! As for thee, King Helge, stood we
not upon this sacred mound, I would smite thee to
the dust! Take heed, hereafter, that thou come
not too near my blade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one blow Frithiof clove in twain Helge&rsquo;s
golden shield, that hung upon an oak tree, and the
two halves fell with a crash that awakened hollow
echoes from the vault below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well struck, my sword!&rdquo; cried Frithiof; &ldquo;hide
now thy gleam and dream thou of exploits more
noble!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>FRITHIOF&rsquo;S wooing</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Terror seized Helge and his followers, and all
looked on silently while Frithiof returned to his
ship and was borne swiftly away over the water out
to the deep blue sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">King Ring</span></h2>
<p>There reigned at this time in the far
North a King named Ring, no longer
young, but gentle and kindly as Balder
himself, and sage as Mimir, who guards
the fount of Wisdom. His realm was peaceful as a
grove of the gods. The greenwood never echoed
to the clash of arms, nor were the cornfields trampled
by the hoofs of battle steeds. Justice held sway
upon the Seat of Judgment about which the people
gathered to hold their Ting, or general assembly,
where each man had a voice in the affairs of the
kingdom. Thither came many a white-sailed vessel,
bringing treasures from a hundred coasts, in exchange
for the country&rsquo;s rich abundance. Wisely and well
had King Ring guided the destinies of his people
for more than thirty years, and prayers for his welfare
ascended daily to Odin&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>One day the King sat with his warriors in the
royal hall. Long was the feast, and many a horn
of foaming mead was drained; but at last he pushed
back his gold chair from the board, while all the
chiefs arose to do honor to the words of their lord.
Sighing deeply, he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble Queen was taken, as ye know, from
out these mists of earth, and now in Frigga&rsquo;s
heavenly bower sits enthroned in purple robes.
Naught remains to me but the flower-decked grave-mound
where she lies. She was the treasure of my
life. But my babes suffer for a mother&rsquo;s care; the
country lacks a queen. King Bele, who was often
wont to be our honored guest, now also shares Valhalla&rsquo;s
joys; but he hath left a daughter, as fair, they
say, as the lily and the rose in one, and her I choose
to be my spouse. &rsquo;Tis true that she is young and
like the Spring, while Winter&rsquo;s frost has touched my
locks with gray; but if it so be that she can trust
an upright heart and nourish affection for helpless
childhood in her breast, then will Autumn offer to the
Spring its throne. Take gold from the vault-rooms,
therefore, and gems and costly apparel from the
chests, and go ye to Ingeborg&rsquo;s brothers with my
suit. Also let minstrels accompany you, that they
may assist your wooing with song and harpstring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A band of chosen warriors set out without delay
and, reaching the Court of King Bele&rsquo;s sons, made
known their errand. Three days they waited for an
answer, while Helge, instead of taking wise counsel
on the matter, offered up horses and falcons on the
sacrificial stone and searched the entrails to discover
the will of the gods. But on the fourth day, Ring&rsquo;s
messengers demanded an answer; whereupon Helge,
deluded by the signs he had perceived, curtly rejected
the monarch&rsquo;s suit and the giddy Halfdan
added jestingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pity our feastings must have an end! Had
King Graybeard but come hither with you, truly I
myself would now have aided him to mount his
horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suppressing their wrath, the envoys returned to
their master with King Helge&rsquo;s answer; nor did they
fail to relate the affront that had been offered them
by Halfdan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An evil hour shall it be for them, that sees King
Graybeard on their shores!&rdquo; cried Ring, as he smote
the great war-shield that hung upon a linden tree in
the castle courtyard. Swift throughout the land sped
the summons to war, and soon a host of warriors had
assembled. The haven was filled with dragon ships,
and countless helm-plumes nodded in the breeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>When the message of war reached King Helge,
he was seized with fear, and hastily despatched his
sister Ingeborg to Balder&rsquo;s temple, which was held
sacred all over the Northland. None had ever dared
to violate this sanctuary, and there he deemed her
safe from King Ring and his warriors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof at Chess</span></h2>
<p>Frithiof was sitting with Bj&ouml;rn in his hall
at Framn&auml;s before a splendid chessboard,
the squares of which were alternate gold and
silver, when Hilding entered. Greeting
the old man kindly, Frithiof led him to the high-seat
and bade him refresh himself with a horn of mead
till he and his adroit adversary should have finished
their match. But without waiting, Hilding began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come on behalf of the two princes, Helge and
Halfdan, to pray you to make peace with them. King
Ring has declared war and they fear for the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heed, Bj&ouml;rn,&rdquo; cried Frithiof, &ldquo;thy King
is in danger! A pawn, indeed, may save him;
pawns are lightly sacrificed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilding, who well understood the double meaning
of these words, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let not thine anger master thee, my son!
Against King Ring the princes may be weak;
against thy single arm &rsquo;twere otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Frithiof smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thou dost threaten my castle, Bj&ouml;rn!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But rest thee assured it will be well
guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Balder&rsquo;s Grove,&rdquo; began Hilding once more,
&ldquo;Ingeborg doth weep the whole day long. Will
not even her prayers move thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Bj&ouml;rn, wouldst thou attack the Queen,
dearer to me than life from childhood&rsquo;s hour?
The most precious piece in all the game is she, and
her I will save, cost what it may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou give me no answer, nor yet end thy
game?&rdquo; asked Hilding, indignantly.</p>
<p>Then Frithiof arose, and grasping his old master&rsquo;s
hand, said earnestly: &ldquo;Nay, be not angry with me,
father, but hearken to my firm resolve. Say to
Bele&rsquo;s sons that never will he whose honor they
have tarnished be their vassal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilding was silent for a space before he replied:
&ldquo;I must e&rsquo;en perform my duty; yet neither can I
blame thee for thy resolution. Odin will guide all
for the best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then mounting his horse, he rode thoughtfully
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof goes to Ingeborg</span></h2>
<p>When the sun had sunk low in the
west, Frithiof said to Bj&ouml;rn: &ldquo;Let us
away, for this night I must speak with
Ingeborg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; cried his friend, &ldquo;wouldst thou violate
Balder&rsquo;s Grove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely &rsquo;twill be no violation of Balder&rsquo;s sanctuary
if I do but seek in all honor and propriety to
hold converse with the King&rsquo;s daughter, my play-fellow
and companion from our infancy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bj&ouml;rn said no more, and &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; soon brought
them to the holy grove, one side of which was
bounded by the sea. By that way it was forbidden
to enter, under penalty of death, while from the land
none but the priests might grant entrance through
the door in the high wall to those wishing to visit
the grove and temple. Paying no heed to this prohibition,
Frithiof boldly entered the grove from the
shore and suddenly appeared before Ingeborg, to
her mingled joy and terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not, dear Ingeborg,&rdquo; he cried, clasping her
hand, &ldquo;that my presence here will profane Balder&rsquo;s
sanctuary. Nay, rather let us go into the temple
and implore his aid and guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence the lovers entered the temple, and not
till the dawn began to break did they emerge and
seek the shore once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now have we plighted our troth before the
gentle god,&rdquo; said Frithiof, &ldquo;and our love for each
other shall therefore be publicly made known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the maiden besought Frithiof to forget
what had passed and be reconciled to her
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy words accord with that which Balder hath
implanted in my breast, fair maid,&rdquo; replied Frithiof,
&ldquo;wherefore I will appear at the Ting and before all
men offer to thy brother Helge the hand of peace.
Soon shalt thou hear thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words they parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Parting</span></h2>
<p>Oft the next day did Ingeborg turn her
footsteps toward the sea, and at last as she
neared the wooded shore once more, the
sails of the swiftly approaching dragon
glimmered through the branches of the trees. It
stopped, and Frithiof leaped lightly ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome indeed art thou, Frithiof!&rdquo; said Ingeborg;
&ldquo;but woe is me! I read my fate upon thy
brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seest thou not also blood-red runes thereon,
bespeaking insult, shame, and banishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, calm thyself, and tell me quickly what has
passed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Learn, then, my Ingeborg, the disgrace that I
am forced to bear! I sought the assembly of the
people gathered at thy father&rsquo;s grave-mound, where,
close circling, stood the Northland&rsquo;s warriors, sword
in hand and shield to shield. Within their ranks
upon the Judgment seat, sat that pale blood-man
Helge, his gloomy gaze fast fixed upon the ground,
while beside him Halfdan, like some overgrown
child, toyed idly with a slender sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I stepped forth and spoke: &lsquo;The clouds
of war, O Helge, overhang thy boundaries. Thy
kingdom is in jeopardy; but give me thy sister, and
I&rsquo;ll lend my arm, whose strength shall stand thee
well in time of need. Forgotten be our grudge, for
loath am I to cherish hate against the brother of my
Ingeborg. Be just, O King! and save at once thy
country and thy sister&rsquo;s heart! As proof of faith I
offer thee my hand in peace; but by the mighty
Thor I swear that never again shall it be stretched
to thee in reconcilement!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud plaudits rang from all about us; the clang
of a thousand shields rose up to heaven. &lsquo;Yea,
give him Ingeborg!&rsquo; they shouted, &lsquo;the fairest lily
in our vales! Remember, King, that Frithiof is our
stoutest swordsman. Give him thy sister!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thereat our noble foster-father, Hilding, stepped
from out the throng and spoke for me. From his
lips fell many a weighty speech and biting proverb,
while even Halfdan, too, did urge consent. But vain
were my words, vain the shouts of the warriors, vain
the intercession of Hilding and Halfdan! As little
might the Spring sun coax a blade of grass from out
the naked rock as our united prayers awake one
kindly thought in Helge&rsquo;s breast. Unchanged his
lowering glance as scornfully he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The peasant&rsquo;s son might claim, perchance, our
sister: but never shall the defiler of a temple win
her hand. Speak, Frithiof! Hast thou not broken
Balder&rsquo;s peace? Hast thou not forced thy way into
his holy temple, despite the law which so forbids?
Answer yea or nay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My life&rsquo;s happiness,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;hangs upon
a word. Yet fear not, Helge; neither for Valhalla&rsquo;s
joys nor all this earth&rsquo;s delights would I forswear
myself. Yea; in Balder&rsquo;s temple I have seen thy
sister, but in no wise did I offend the pure and gentle
god. Our prayers to him did waken holy thoughts
within our hearts and led me here to offer peace to
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More I could not speak, for a murmur of horror
ran through the circle; the warriors, paled by superstition,
drew back from me as I were smitten
with the plague; thy brother&rsquo;s was the victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last he spoke: &lsquo;By the laws of our fathers,
mine is the right to sentence thee to banishment or
death: but rather will I emulate in mildness that
god whose sanctuary thou hast violated. Hearken
then to my decree. Far to the westward lies a group
of islands ruled by Augantyr. King Bele long ago
did lay him under tribute, and this he faithfully remitted
so long as our royal father was alive. Since
Bele&rsquo;s death he has refused it. Go thou and collect
this tribute, as atonement for thy crime!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he added sneeringly: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis said this Augantyr
is hard-handed and sits brooding o&rsquo;er his gold
like Fafner, the famed dragon slain by Sigurd. But
who could withstand our second Sigurd&rsquo;s prowess?
Truly this is far other work than seeking maids in
Balder&rsquo;s holy grove! Here till the Summer comes
again we&rsquo;ll wait for thy return, bringing fresh glory
and&mdash;above all else&mdash;the tribute! But shouldst
thou fail in this&mdash;thou shalt be doomed as coward,
branded and banished forever from thy native land!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ended his words; the assembly was dissolved,
and the warriors dispersed in silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is now thy purpose, Frithiof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I a choice? This very day I depart to
redeem my honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, come with me, my Ingeborg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! that may not be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet hear me, beloved, ere thou dost fix thy
firm resolve. Thy brother in his wisdom forgets
that Augantyr was once my father&rsquo;s friend as well
as Bele&rsquo;s. Perchance he&rsquo;ll yield with good-will
what I ask; but should he not, this friend I carry
at my side shall prove a sharp and powerful persuader.
Then will I send to King Helge the gold
he so desireth and free us both forever from the
sacrificial knife of that crowned hypocrite; then we,
my Ingeborg, will seek some distant happier land,
and bid farewell to shores so hostile to our happiness.
Look, my &lsquo;Ellida&rsquo; doth already spread her
eagle&rsquo;s wings to bear us swiftly o&rsquo;er the waves!
Come, beloved, haste thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! I cannot follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hinders thee, my Ingeborg? Were thy
good father but alive, and did he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget not, Frithiof, that Helge holds my
father&rsquo;s place with me. The gods have blessed and
woven these bonds, and a woman dare not break
them to steal her happiness, however near it
lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more consider. Is this word thy last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! dear Frithiof, I cannot, dare not do else,
if I would maintain my honor and thy own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then fare thee well, King Helge&rsquo;s sister&mdash;fare
thee well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Frithiof, Frithiof, is it thus thou wouldst depart&mdash;without
a glance, without a hand-clasp for
thy childhood&rsquo;s friend? Methinks one who is
forced to sacrifice as much as I, doth well deserve
at least a word of comfort. The stir of life and
clash of arms will ease thy grief, but what remains
for me? To whom, alas! may I impart my woe?
Within my bower I&rsquo;ll sit, thinking of thee and
weaving broken lilies in my web, till Spring herself
with fairer lilies shall adorn my grave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cease! cease!&rdquo; cried Frithiof with deep emotion,
as he clasped the maiden&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Forgive
me that my sorrow did assume the garb of anger.
Thou art right. I see it now, my better angel.
&rsquo;Tis true that only noble minds can teach us what
is noble, and thy pure heart was quicker far to see
the right than mine. Alone I&rsquo;ll go, and part from
thee&mdash;but never from my hope, whate&rsquo;er betide!
Next Spring shall Helge see me here again, the
crime with which he charges me atoned. Then in
full circle of the warriors, &rsquo;mid glittering steel will I
demand thee from thy brother as my wife. Till
then farewell, and keep me ever in thy thoughts.
In memory of our childhood&rsquo;s love take thou this
arm-ring, a treasured heirloom of my father&rsquo;s house:
all the wonders of the heavens are carved upon it&mdash;but
the world&rsquo;s best wonder is a faithful heart.
See! how it gleams on thy white arm like a glow-worm
upon a lily&rsquo;s stem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they parted, and &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; bore the hero
swiftly away, while Ingeborg, sad and hopeless, betook
her to her bower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Voyage</span></h2>
<p>Cold blew the wind; day by day the
skies darkened; deck and mast, sail and
rudder were covered thick with ice and
frost. Frithiof was already far from his
native shores when suddenly black storm clouds
overspread the heavens and a fearful tempest arose.
The sea was stirred to its depths; waves mountain-high
threatened to engulf the ship, which tossed
helplessly amid the boiling surges. But Frithiof
exulted in the fury of the elements; the wild scene
upon which he gazed was but a reflection of the
storm that raged within his breast. Still the tempest
increased; showers of hailstones rattled down
upon the deck and on the numbed hands of the
warriors at the helm. A gust of wind tore away the
cordage; planks and timbers groaned and creaked;
huge billows swept the deck; and higher and higher
rose the water in the hold despite all the efforts of
the ship&rsquo;s people, who now gave themselves up for
lost. Even to Frithiof it seemed death was nigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is Helge that hath sent this storm upon us,&rdquo;
said one, &ldquo;and who may withstand witchcraft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;yonder swims a whale
and bears on its back two sea-fiends! One is
wrapped in the hide of the ice-bear; the other hath
the shape of a sea-eagle, with black wings flapping.
Woe unto us! &rsquo;tis the sea trolls, Heid and Ham!
We are lost!&rdquo; But Frithiof, summoning his friend
Bj&ouml;rn to take the helm, hastened to reassure the
terror-stricken crew. His words put fresh courage
in their hearts, and with redoubled strength they began
once more to struggle against the fury of the
storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, friends!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;those who
trust in the gods are safe from the power of evil
spirits.&rdquo; Then, springing to the ship&rsquo;s prow, he
chanted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now &ldquo;Ellida,&rdquo; show us</p>
<p class="t0">Whether, as &rsquo;tis boasted,</p>
<p class="t0">Hero-wood thy bosom holds!</p>
<p class="t0">Listen! Art thou truly</p>
<p class="t0">&AElig;gir&rsquo;s God-sprung daughter?</p>
<p class="t0">Dash with thy strong keel, and</p>
<p class="t0">Cleave yon spell-charmed whale!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>With one bound the dragon clove the Troll-whale&rsquo;s
body, and down it sank beneath the waves.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then, at once, the Hero hurleth</p>
<p class="t0">Two sharp spears; the ice-bear&rsquo;s hide</p>
<p class="t0">Pierceth one&mdash;the other springeth</p>
<p class="t0">Through the pitch-black eagle&rsquo;s side!</p>
</div>
<p>Instantly the storm subsided. The sun broke
through the clouds and the waves no longer swept
the deck. Soon the sea was as smooth as glass, and
there before them lay the islands ruled by Augantyr.
But the weary rowers could no longer move their
arms, the warriors were forced to lean for support
upon their swords. When the ship touched land,
Bj&ouml;rn carried four and Frithiof eight of the exhausted
men ashore. Food and drink were then
brought from the ship, and all refreshed themselves
with a hearty meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof at the Court of Augantyr</span></h2>
<p>In his great hall near the sea sat Augantyr at
wassail with his champions, while outside the
window Halvar kept watch. A good swordsman
and stout drinker was he, and often as his
horn was empty he silently thrust it through the lattice
to be refilled. Suddenly he flung it far into the
hall and shouted: &ldquo;I see a ship making to land! On
it pale warriors totter helplessly about; but so strong
and fresh are two of them that they carry the others
to the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Augantyr strode to the window and gazed out
toward the sea. Then he said: &ldquo;That, methinks,
hath the look of &lsquo;Ellida,&rsquo; Thorsten&rsquo;s dragon ship,
and in one of yonder two stout warriors I seem to
see old Thorsten&rsquo;s form and bearing. Hath he not
the air of a prince of all the land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the black-bearded Atle heard this, the
Berserk fury seized him. He sprang from the
board with eyes rolling and shouted&mdash;&ldquo;If this be
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
Frithiof, now will I prove the truth of what is said,
that he hath power to render harmless every blade,
and never is the first to sue for peace.&rdquo; He rushed
from the hall, followed by twelve of the warriors.
Hewing and thrusting furiously at the air with their
swords, they stormed down to the shore, where
Frithiof had built a fire to cheer his men. From
afar, Atle shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy were it now for me to slay thee; but
rather shalt thou have thy choice&mdash;to do battle
with me here, or fly. But if thou wilt yield and sue
for peace, then in friendly guise I&rsquo;ll lead thee to our
lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your custom thus to welcome toil-worn
heroes cast upon your shores?&rdquo; was Frithiof&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;Then listen! Spent as I am with days
of hardship and distress, yet never will I sue for
peace from thee&rdquo;; and therewith he drew his sword,
the runes on the blade growing red as fire. Fast
and furious fell the sword-strokes. Both shields at
the same moment dropped, riven in twain, upon the
ground; yet fearlessly the champions fought on.
At last down swept Angurvadel with resistless force,
and loudly clanging Atle&rsquo;s blade was shattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Frithiof stepped back, saying, &ldquo;Swordless I will
not slay thee; but if thou wouldst not yet have
peace then let us try a wrestling contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foaming with rage, Atle sprang at him and a
fearful struggle began. Like two eagles seizing on
their prey, they grappled with each other. The
earth shook with the trampling of their feet. It
seemed as if the heaving of their breasts would burst
the encasing mail, while in awe their comrades stood
about them waiting for the issue of the contest. At
length Thorsten&rsquo;s mighty son succeeded in throwing
his adversary, and, kneeling on his breast, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were but my sword within my grasp, its blade
e&rsquo;er now had pierced thee through, thou swarthy
Berserk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, then, and fetch it&mdash;I will lie here the
while,&rdquo; said Atle proudly. &ldquo;All brave men to Valhalla&rsquo;s
halls must wend at last&mdash;I to-day and thou
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still filled with the rage of battle, Frithiof with
one bound reached his sword and was about to despatch
his prostrate foe, who moved not, but lay
calmly gazing upward, when he suddenly relented
and, dropping his sword, held out his hand to the
vanquished Atle. Just then Halvar came hurrying
thither waving a white wand and crying:</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="433" />
<p class="caption"><i>FRITHIOF&rsquo;S wrestle</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cease, cease your furious strife! The savory
viands that await ye grow cold in their silver dishes,
and my thirst doth press me sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith the two heroes who but now had
striven in deadly combat together sought the court
of Augantyr in peace.</p>
<p>The appearance of the great hall filled Frithiof
with astonishment. In place of the usual oaken
planks the walls were covered with gilded leather
adorned with flowering vines. The chimney was
of marble; tapers in silver candlesticks illuminated
the halls; the doors were held fast with locks. A
bountiful meal stood ready spread in heavy silver
dishes, and near the high-seat a roasted stag adorned
the board, the horns entwined with leaves, the
hoofs gilded. On the high-seat of silver sat Augantyr,
clad in helm and mail of glittering steel, inlaid
with gold, a purple mantel sown with silver stars
depending from his shoulders. He arose as Frithiof
entered, and advanced to meet his guest, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full many a horn have I drained in Thorsten&rsquo;s
company, and glad am I to do fitting honor to his
valiant son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Then leading him to a place beside him on the
high-seat, he called on all his warriors to fill their
horns and beakers and drink to Thorsten&rsquo;s memory,
while the hall rang to the sound of harps, as minstrels
praised that hero&rsquo;s glorious deeds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Augantyr questioned his guest concerning
matters in the Northland; and in well-chosen
words, avoiding either praise or blame, Frithiof
related all that had passed, concluding with his voyage
and the terrible sea witches against whose power
they had been forced to contend. So eloquently
did he describe their adventures that Augantyr
listened with approving smiles, and the bold champions
about the board often interrupted the speaker
with their shouts. Then Augantyr inquired the
purpose of his voyage, and Frithiof told him frankly
of his love for Ingeborg, of Helge&rsquo;s arrogance, and
the penance that had been laid upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this have I come,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;to demand
of thee in behalf of Kings Helge and Halfdan,
the tribute thou wast wont to pay in Bele&rsquo;s lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Calmly Augantyr replied: &ldquo;Never have I owned
another as my lord. Free do I live; free also are my
people about these seas. What I sent Bele was
not enforced, but given in friendship. His sons I
know not. If they would have tribute from me, let
them demand it with the sword&mdash;then shall they
have the best of answers! Yet thy father was my
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to his daughter, who sat near him
on a golden stool, and she hastened to the women&rsquo;s
chamber, soon returning with a purse whereon was
worked with rare skill a green forest scene&mdash;animals
of gold wandered beneath the trees, and above shone
a silver moon. The tassels were strung with costly
pearls, the clasp enriched with rubies. Augantyr
took this purse, filled it to the brim with pieces of
gold, and handed it to his guest, saying, &ldquo;Take
this as a gift of welcome, son of Thorsten, and do
with it as thou wilt; but as for claim, I refuse to acknowledge
any such. Hear now my wish: tarry
thou here till Spring comes, as my honored guest.
Courage and boldness stand thee well in time of
danger, it is true, yet think not thine &lsquo;Ellida&rsquo; may
withstand all the perils of the stormy season. And
remember there are demons in the sea more mighty
yet than those which thou didst vanquish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Frithiof gladly agreed, and he held out
his hand to his hospitable host, saying: &ldquo;Be it,
then, as thou wilt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Return</span></h2>
<p>The winter passed, and again were hill
and valley, grove and forest, clothed with
bloom and verdure. Then Frithiof
thanked his host, and, bidding him farewell,
was soon speeding joyously away across the
foaming main. Six times the sun rose and set, and
the seventh morning found him near his journey&rsquo;s
end. Consumed with longing, Frithiof rose early
and mounted to the deck. There, veiled in the
mists of dawn, he saw his native shores and heard
the familiar rushing of its mountain streams. Light
as a bird flew &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; o&rsquo;er the dancing waves and
in her swelling sails the western breezes sang like
nightingales. Just as the first ray of sunlight fell
on land and sea they entered the well-known haven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Past the green birch woods now,&rdquo; cried Frithiof
to Bj&ouml;rn, &ldquo;and Framn&auml;s greets me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>With beating heart and gleaming eyes he waited&mdash;but
what is this? Is he bewitched? There lies the
open space where his forefathers built their dwelling,
yet naught is to be seen of it. Do his eyes deceive
him? He rubs them and looks again at the familiar
spot; but neither house nor building of any kind is
there, only a tall blackened chimney stands out dark
against the sky. Looking closer, where Framn&auml;s
stood, he sees a great pile of ruins, from which the
ashes whirl aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellida&rsquo;s&rdquo; anchor is dropped, and silently Frithiof
approaches the scene of devastation. Stones and
charred beams are strewn around or heaped together
in confusion; fruit trees stretch forth their shrivelled
branches; about the levelled grave-mounds lie the
bones of heroes. As Frithiof stands spellbound
amid the desolation, his faithful hound Bran comes
bounding to meet him. Yelping with joy he leaps
upon his master, while out from the dale trots a
milk-white courser, neighing and tossing his gold-knotted
mane. Frithiof stroked the dog&rsquo;s head and
patted his favorite&rsquo;s glossy neck; but the shadow
on his brow remained unaltered. Then he saw
Hilding, his aged foster-father coming toward him
with mournful look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, father, to the ruins of Framn&auml;s!&rdquo; he
cried, and then added bitterly: &ldquo;But why should
this sight surprise me? &rsquo;Tis when the eagle is flown
that boys plunder his nest. So thus doth King
Helge guard the hut of the peasant; thus he keeps
his royal oath! Rage at his dastardly act more
moves me than grief for what is lost. But tell me
first of all, good father, where is Ingeborg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my son,&rdquo; replied Hilding, &ldquo;I fear my
tidings will but aggravate thy woe, yet listen to what
has passed. Scarce wert thou gone when King Ring
invaded the country, his force outnumbering ours
full five to one. In the Disardale we met, and
bloody was the battle. The waters of the stream
ran red with gore. Halfdan, as ever, laughed and
jested; but so bravely did he bear him, my heart
was gladdened at the sight, and twice did my shield
protect him from a death-stroke. The victory
might even have been ours, had not King Helge,
seized with panic, fled; whereat the people&rsquo;s courage,
too, forsook them, and, flinging down their arms, they
scattered far and wide. But in his flight King Helge
paused to fire thy house. Ring then demanded of
the brothers lands and crown, or that they yield him
up their sister&rsquo;s hand. Messengers went often to
and fro, and in the end King Ring bore Ingeborg
homeward as his Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Frithiof laughed wildly: &ldquo;Who now,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;dare talk to me of woman&rsquo;s truth, since she whom
I deemed true as Nanna&rsquo;s self hath proven faithless?
Hereafter naught but hate for mankind shall my
bosom harbor; henceforth the seas shall have their
fill of blood, for none who cross my path shall Angurvadel
spare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, son,&rdquo; said Hilding sorrowfully, &ldquo;abate
thy wrath, nor seek to revenge thy wrongs upon the
innocent. Rather accuse the Norns, whose doom
on thee hath fallen. What Ingeborg doth suffer I
alone can tell. Before all others her despair was
dumb as is the turtle dove that mourns her mate.
So doth the sea fowl, pierced by death&rsquo;s arrow, sink
beneath the waves, in those cool depths to pour
away her life. &lsquo;Atonement&rsquo;&mdash;so she spake&mdash;&lsquo;hath
been decreed by Balder for Frithiof&rsquo;s violation of
his holy place; nor may I, faint-hearted, seek to
shun the sacrifice. To death he dooms me, not
swift,&mdash;ah! that were easy,&mdash;but lingering&mdash;slow,
to waste away with grief. To that decree I yield.
Reveal to no one what I suffer. I desire pity from
none. But be thou the bearer of my last farewell
to Frithiof.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last the wedding day was come (Oh, would
that evil day had never dawned!); to Balder&rsquo;s
temple walked a train of white-robed maidens, led
by a bard whose mournful chant moved every heart
to woe. Amid them, on a coal-black steed rode
Ingeborg, like that pale spirit which surmounts the
thunder cloud. Before the doors of the temple I
lifted my lily from her saddle and led her to the altar.
With unfaltering tongue she spoke her vows;
but unto Balder then she prayed in such heart-rending
tones that every eye save hers was filled with
tears. Then for the first time Helge marked the
ring she wore. With a furious glance he tore it
from her and placed thy gift upon the arm of Balder.
But thereat I could no longer suppress my
rage, and, snatching my sword from out its sheath,
approached the King as he stood before the image
of the god. Of as little worth was he to me at that
moment as the lowest of his people, and verily a
crime would have been committed in that sacred
place had not a whisper reached my ears from Ingeborg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, stay thy hand. Stain not thy spotless
blade! My brother might indeed have spared me
this; but much a heart can suffer ere it break, and
the All-Father shall one day judge between us!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Ingeborg,&rdquo; cried Frithiof, &ldquo;thou speakest
truly&mdash;the All-Father will one day judge between
us! But he also metes out justice here below by
mortal hand, and &rsquo;tis in my heart that I am hither
led to be the judge of one. Is not to-day the
Midsummer feast of Balder, that Helge celebrates
within his temple? Now, crowned priest, thou who
hast sold thy sister, thou who hast robbed me of
my bride, behold to-day thy judge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Burning of the Temple</span></h2>
<p>It was midnight. Low across the mountains
burned the blood-red sun, which in far northern
Scandinavia never sets on the longest day of
the year. Neither day nor night was it&mdash;an
awful twilight reigned. Within the temple Balder&rsquo;s
great feast was being celebrated. High in the air
shot the flames from the sacred hearthstone, while
pale, white-bearded priests raked the brands till
showers of crackling sparks flew upward. Clad in
his royal robes, Helge presided at the altar.</p>
<p>Suddenly the clash of arms sounded without, and
a voice was heard: &ldquo;Bj&ouml;rn, hold fast the door!
Let none escape! If any strive by force to pass
thee, cleave his skull!&rdquo; Helge grew deadly pale;
he knew that voice too well. Then in strode Frithiof
and addressed him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the tribute thou didst order me to bring
thee from Augantyr. Take it! And now, for life
or death we&rsquo;ll strive before this altar. One of us
twain must burn on Balder&rsquo;s pyre. Shieldless we&rsquo;ll
fight and thou, as befits a King, shalt have first
stroke. But beware, I say, for I strike second.
Nay&mdash;gaze not fearfully about, nor seek escape,
King Fox! Caught in thy hole art thou at last.
Remember Framn&auml;s that thou didst lay waste,
and think of Ingeborg&rsquo;s cheeks, blanched by
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside himself with fury, Frithiof tore the heavy
purse of gold from his belt and hurled it at the head
of the King, who straightway sank swooning on the
altar steps, blood gushing from his mouth and
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! canst thou not bear the weight of thine
own gold?&rdquo; shouted Frithiof. &ldquo;Shame! shame!
thou coward King! Truly my sword is far too
noble for thee, nor shall it taste of blood so base as
thine. Silence, ye pale priests of moonlight, nor
dare to lift your sacrificial knives! Back, back, I
say, for thirsty grows my blade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes to the image of Balder. &ldquo;Thou
shining god, frown not so darkly on me!&rdquo; Then,
perceiving the arm-ring he had given to Ingeborg,
his anger blazed up fiercer than before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;by thy leave,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;that ring came
not in lawful fashion on thy arm! Not for thee did
Vaunlund forge its wonders; and he who is its master
claims his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled at the ring, but it seemed grown fast
to Balder&rsquo;s arm. Putting forth all his strength, at
last he tore it loose; but therewith down crashed the
image of the god into the fire below. Higher and
higher leaped the flames, till beam and rafter kindled.
Horror-stricken, Frithiof stood for a moment
motionless; then turning to the door, he
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, Bj&ouml;rn! Let all depart! The feast is
over. The temple blazes; bring water! Hasten,
all, to quench the flames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly a chain of men to the sea is formed.
From hand to hand the buckets fly, while high up
among the rafters stands Frithiof, calm amid the
mounting flames, and directs his comrades. But
vain are all their efforts. The golden plates
of the roof melt and drop down into the fiery
sands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is lost!&rdquo; shout the people. &ldquo;See the red
fire-cock, how he stands upon the roof-tree and ever
wider spreads his glowing wings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>A strong wind arose and whirled the flaming
brands into the treetops, dry from the summer
heats. Raging from branch to branch it leaped,
and soon the whole grove was one sea of fire. When
morning broke, Balder&rsquo;s Grove and Temple lay in
ashes, while Frithiof sat within his dragon ship and
wept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof in Exile</span></h2>
<p>As &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; passed the strand, Frithiof gazed
from the deck with gloomy brow upon
the scene of conflagration, from which the
thick smoke still ascended, and anguish
filled his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe, woe is me!&rdquo; he cried to himself; &ldquo;in accusation
rises yonder smoke to Odin&rsquo;s halls! Banished
was I by Helge but for a brief space; now must I
forever leave my native land. Be thou, O sea, from
hence my country. On thy blue billows will I
make my home. Framn&auml;s no longer is my dwelling;
thou, swift &lsquo;Ellida,&rsquo; shalt be now my house.
My bride, too, art thou in thy black garb, since she
in lily robes is lost to me forever. Free dost thou
roll, O mighty ocean! No tyrant&rsquo;s will can ever do
thee wrong; the only King thou callest master is he
who looks upon thee calmly when thy white breast
heaves in wildest fury, and thunder peals are swallowed
in thy voice. No grave-mound e&rsquo;er shall rise above
me; thy tossing waves shall cover deep my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Here Bj&ouml;rn approached and touched his shoulder,
saying, &ldquo;Look! yonder King Helge makes his way
amid the rocks. Methinks he hath yet a word to
speak with thee.&rdquo; Ten dragon ships were seen
approaching. Frithiof sprang to his feet and
bade his men prepare for battle. Joyously they
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;King Helge wearies of the crown. His soul
thirsts for Valhalla&rsquo;s delights. Now shall he fall;
bold Frithiof leads us unto victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On came the ships in a half-circle, surrounding
&ldquo;Ellida.&rdquo; Helge had given orders to slay Frithiof
and all his men, but to capture the ship as their
prize. Suddenly a strange sight met the eyes of
Frithiof and his warriors and filled them with
amazement: nine of the ships sank slowly down
beneath the waves, while Helge himself escaped with
difficulty to the shore. Bj&ouml;rn laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas I that scuttled the ships last night, unseen.
A good trick it was, and all befell as I had
hoped, save that King Helge has escaped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all the sails were spread and the ship sped
swiftly out to sea. Backward gazing, Frithiof
watched the fast receding shore and chanted a song
that moved all hearts to sadness:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Farewell! mounds dreaming</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Viking Life</span></h2>
<p>Thus Frithiof became a viking, the sea
his only home; and these are the laws
he made for his followers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pitch no tent on thy ship; seek no slumber below.
On his shield sleeps the viking, his sword in his
hand. His tent is the blue dome of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short be thy sword, like the hammer of Thor; strike
close to the foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the storm roars on high, spread wider the sails:
The sea in its wrath fills the viking with joy; a coward is
he who would furl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wine is drink of the gods. Enjoy thou the gift, but
drown not thy senses&mdash;beware! He who falls on the land
rises quickly again; who staggers here is the death-goddess&rsquo;
prey!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protect the merchant ship on the high seas so due
tribute it doth not refuse. Thou art lord of the waves;
he&rsquo;s a slave to his pelf. Thy steel is as good as his gold.
By lot shall the booty be shared among all; complain not
however it falls. The Sea King himself throws no dice on
the deck; he seeks only glory from his foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaves a viking in sight, then come boarding and
strife; from us he is banished who yields. Mercy fits him
who conquers; he who lays down his arms at thy feet is no
longer thy foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prayer is Valhalla&rsquo;s child, and a scoundrel is he who,
ruthless, refuses to hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The viking&rsquo;s rewards are his wounds; before all, on
the brow and the breast are they glorious. He who seeketh
ere issue of battle to bind them no longer is comrade of
viking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Thus ran the code of Frithiof, and no laws of
Odin were more strictly obeyed. Many a battle
did these heroes fight and win, for there was not
their like on all the seas; and soon their fame
spread far and wide. But naught of this had power
to gladden Frithiof&rsquo;s heart; he would sit, helm in
hand, for hours with clouded brow, gazing out over
the rolling waters. Only in battle did the shadow
vanish, as with flashing eyes and fiercely swelling
breast he led his men to victory.</p>
<p>For three years they sailed the seas northward and
westward; then turning south, his dragon anchored
one day off the coast of Greek-land (Greece). With
wonder Frithiof gazed upon that beauteous land,
with its noble ruined temples rising amid fragrant
groves. The tales his father had been wont to tell
of those fair isles still lingered in his memory like
some lovely vision&mdash;a dream that now was realized.
Hither had he once thought to flee with Ingeborg
from the haughty Helge, here with her to found an
abode of bliss, but the noble maiden had denied his
prayers and shrunk from such a breach of duty and
of custom. Amid these fair scenes memories of his
native land awoke afresh within him, and he longed
to see it once again. But most of all he yearned
for a sight of Ingeborg and to visit his father&rsquo;s grave-mound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do I linger here in strange seas and stain my
hands with blood?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Enough
of glory have I won, and I care not for gold. North
points the flag on the masthead. To the Northland
the home of my youth! Up, &lsquo;Ellida&rsquo;! no longer
we&rsquo;ll tarry, but follow that token from Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof comes to King Ring&rsquo;s Court</span></h2>
<p>On his high-seat sat King Ring, celebrating
the great Yule tide feast that fell on the
winter solstice, and beside him Ingeborg,
his wife, like chilly Autumn with the
youthful Spring. The mead-horn went round, and
joyous shouts and laughter filled the hall. Suddenly
through the doorway entered an old man, tall of
stature and wrapped from head to foot in a great
bearskin. In his hand he bore a staff and walked
as if bowed with age. None knew him, and he
quietly took his place on the bench near the door,
reserved for the poor. The courtiers smiled to one
another and pointed jeeringly at the shaggy figure,
while one playfully approached with intent to make
sport of him for the amusement of the others.
With flashing eyes the stranger seized the rash
youth, whirled him about in the air, and set him
again on his feet unharmed; whereat the courtiers&rsquo;
smiles deserted them, and they fell straightway
silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;What noise is that down yonder?&rdquo; cried Ring
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither, old man, who thus disturbest our
kingly peace! Who art thou? What brings thee
here? Whence comest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much dost thou ask, O King,&rdquo; replied the
stranger, &ldquo;yet all will I tell thee save my name,&mdash;that
concerneth none but me. In Penitence was I
reared; Want was my inheritance; my latest bed
a Wolf&rsquo;s lair. Astride my dragon, with its mighty
wings, I flew swiftly hither from afar; now my good
ship lies frozen in upon thy shores. I came to hear
thy words of wisdom, famed through all the land.
When thy people just now sought to mock me, I
seized a vain fool and swung him round about&mdash;but
I did him no harm. Forgive me, King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; the monarch cried,&mdash;&ldquo;thou speakest
well, and wisdom&rsquo;s teachings bid us honor age.
Come, sit at the board. But first, I pray thee, doff
thy strange disguisement and show thyself in thy
true form, for deception is ever wont to be the foe
of gladness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>At this the stranger let fall his hairy covering, and
there, in place of an old man, appeared a youth of
noble stature, his loft brow shaded with bright
flowing locks. A blue mantle hung from his
mighty shoulders, and his tunic was held in place
by a wide silver belt, on which, with cunning skill,
beasts of the forest were embossed. Heavy gold
armlets encircled his arm; at his left side hung a
sword that gleamed like lightning. Fair as Balder,
like to the mighty Thor in strength of limb, he
stood before the King and his astonished court.
For a moment his keen glance wandered about the
hall, then he seated himself calmly at the board.
The blood rushed to the cheeks of the Queen till
she glowed as crimson as the ice-fields lit by flaring
Northern lights.</p>
<p>But now the trumpets sounded the signal for
silence. It was the hour of the vow, and the crowned
boar was borne into the hall on a silver charger and
placed upon the board. Touching the head of the
boar, Ring said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken, ye warriors, to my vow! I swear to
conquer Frithiof, howsoever stout a champion he
be; so help me Odin, Thor, and Frey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger rose with a frown and dashed his
sword upon the board with such a clang that all the
warriors sprang from their seats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou me likewise, good Sir King,&rdquo; he
cried: &ldquo;That Frithiof whom thou namest is my
friend and kinsman: and him I swear to guard with
life and limb, so help me Norns and my good
sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King smiled. &ldquo;Thou speakest boldly,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;but words are free in Northland&rsquo;s royal
halls. Fill for him, Queen, yon horn with draught
of welcome. I hope he&rsquo;ll tarry with us as our guest
till Spring returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This horn was a precious heirloom of the house,
broken from the forehead of the urus. Its feet
were of silver wonderfully wrought, while the golden
rings about it were carven with strange runes. With
downcast eyes Ingeborg handed it to the guest, but
she trembled so that the wine was spilled, and red
drops gleamed on her white hand like evening&rsquo;s
purple blushes on a lily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Unmoved, the hero took the mighty horn, lifted
it to his lips and at one draught drained it to the
honor of his host. Then at a sign from the King,
the scald smote on his harpstrings and chanted
many a heart-stirring song and legend. In lofty
words he sang of love and friendship, of freedom
and the country&rsquo;s glory, of the high gods and
Valhalla&rsquo;s wonders, till fire shot forth from every
eye, and involuntarily each warrior grasped the
handle of his sword.</p>
<p>Deeply they drank throughout the night, and
many a champion, like a tower of strength in battle,
was vanquished by the sweetly foaming mead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Sledge Excursion</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ho for a sledge ride over the frozen lake!&rdquo;
cried Ring one day; and the servitors
hastened to loose one of the pawing
steeds from the royal stables and harness
it before a splendid sledge, over the seat of
which was thrown a silky sealskin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not safe on the lake,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;The ice is thin and weak in some parts, and
should it give way, full cold and deep would be thy
bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, not so easily do monarchs drown,&rdquo; replied
the King; &ldquo;let him who fears it, go around the
shore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger said no more, but frowning darkly,
hastened to fasten on his steel skates, while the impatient
courser pawed the air and whinnied loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed on, my steed,&rdquo; cried Ring, &ldquo;and let us
see if thou art sprung from Sleipner&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Away dashed the sledge with the speed of the
whirlwind, the stout-hearted old king exulting in the
motion and heeding not the entreaties of his wife;
but swift as they flew, the stranger still outstripped
them, circling about in wide curves or cutting
figures on the ice. Meanwhile, false Ran, the spouse
of the Sea-god, has marked what is passing above.
She cleaves a broad fissure in the sea&rsquo;s silvery roof,
and into the up-foaming waves plunge horse and
sledge. But swift as the wind flies the stranger
thither. Fixing his steel shoes firmly in the ice, he
seizes the horse by the mane and with a mighty
jerk, pulls it and sledge together back on to the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sooth,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that deed doth merit
praise; e&rsquo;en Frithiof himself could do no better.
And now, my Fleet-of-foot, let us back to the palace
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frithiof&rsquo;s Temptation</span></h2>
<p>Spring is come once more; birds warble in
the treetops; freed from their icy bonds,
the streams leap gaily downward to the
vales below; the roses part their delicate
sheaths and blossom red as Frigga&rsquo;s cheeks. King
Ring will now go hunting, and forthwith a joyous
stir pervades the court. Bows twang, quivers rattle,
fiery coursers paw the ground, the hooded falcon
screams for its victim, and scarce can the huntsmen
keep in leash the eager hounds. Fair as Frigga,
dazzling as the battle-maiden Rota, sits the Queen
upon her milk-white steed like a star on a summer
cloud. Her hunting dress is of green, embroidered
with gold, and blue plumes wave from her velvet
cap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Led by the royal pair, the gay train wends its
way into the forest, and soon the sport begins.
Loud bay the hounds; up mount the hawks into
the clear sky; horns sound; the frightened game
seeks lair and covert; and the eager huntsmen
scatter in pursuit.</p>
<p>King Ring has fallen behind; old and feeble, he
can no longer follow the lengthening chase, while
beside him silent and thoughtful, rides his guest.
At last they reached a rocky glen shut in by thick-clustering
trees and thickets, and here the King
dismounted from his courser, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full weary am I, stranger; here will I rest me
in this pleasant spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sleep not on the cold hard ground,&rdquo; replied
the other; &ldquo;I had better lead thee back to thy own
halls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet slumber comes when least expected; &rsquo;tis
the way of the gods,&rdquo; said Ring. &ldquo;Surely thou
dost not grudge thy host an hour of rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further words, the stranger spread his
cloak upon the ground and seated himself on a
fallen tree-trunk, while Ring, stretching himself out
upon the mantle, laid his head against the other&rsquo;s
knees. His eyes closed and soon he slept, sweetly
as an infant cradled in its mother&rsquo;s arms. As the
stranger gazed gloomily down on the face of the
King, he heard a rustling in the branches above him
to the left, and lifting his eyes he saw a coal-black
bird, which began to sing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Haste thee, Frithiof, slay the dotard, with one sword-stroke grant him rest!</p>
<p class="t0">Take the Queen; she&rsquo;s thine; her sacred kiss of plighted troth she gave.</p>
<p class="t0">Here no human eye can see thee&mdash;silent is the deep, dark grave!</p>
</div>
<p>Scarce had the sound ceased when from a bough
on the right, a snow-white bird began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Though no human eye should see thee, Odin would the death-stroke view.</p>
<p class="t0">Wouldst thou murder him in slumber? Cowardly thy bright sword stain?</p>
<p class="t0">Know, whate&rsquo;er besides thou winnest, hero-fame thou ne&rsquo;er shalt gain!</p>
</div>
<p>Thus sang the two birds, while contending
thoughts struggled within the listener. Suddenly
he seized his sword by the handle and flung it far
from him into the shadow of the forest. Whereupon
the black bird, with heavy flapping of its wings,
flew back to the dark halls of Night, the abode of
perjurers and assassins; while, blithely warbling,
upward the white bird took its flight and vanished
at last in the blue of heaven. At that moment the
King awoke and rising to his feet, said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet indeed hath been my slumber. Well
they rest whom valor&rsquo;s sword doth guard. But
where is thy war blade, stranger? Methought the
Brother of Lightning never left thy side. Say, who
hath parted you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little boots it,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;swords
are plenty in the Northland. The sword is not
always a good companion. Its tongue is sharp and
it speaketh few words of peace. In steel there dwells
an evil spirit, sprung from Loke&rsquo;s dark abode, to
whom not even sleep is sacred, nor the silver locks
of age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken, youth!&rdquo; began the King. &ldquo;I slept
not. &rsquo;Twas but to try thee I did feign to slumber&mdash;a
fool is he who trusts a man or a blade untried.
Thou art Frithiof! I knew thee even when thou
didst cross my threshold. But wherefore didst thou
creep nameless and in such disguise into my palace?
Wherefore, if not to rob me of my wife? Honor
comes not nameless to the banquet, Frithiof! Ever
open-faced she meets men&rsquo;s glances, clear as sunlight
is her shield. The fame of Frithiof&rsquo;s deeds
has reached us,&mdash;a terror both of gods and men;
careless alike of cloven shield or burning temple;
the mightiest warrior known in all the land. And
this bold hero, this fierce viking, creeps, a beggar,
to our hall! Nay, cast not down thy eyes before
me. I, too, have once been young and felt as thou.
Youth, well I know, hath fiery passions. Much
have I thought on thee, O Frithiof. I have pitied
and have pardoned thee. Hearken now! I am
growing old and feeble, and soon for me the grave
shall open. Then take unto thyself my kingdom
and my wife. Until that time, be thou a son to me
and guard my house as thou hast done before.
And now, my son, let there be no more feud
between us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not as a thief did I enter thy halls, O King,&rdquo;
replied Frithiof proudly. &ldquo;Had I come to seize
thy Queen, who could have withstood me? &rsquo;Twas
but to behold once again her who before the altar
gave me her betrothal kiss. But ah, what slumbering
fires my rashness hath awakened! Too long
already have I tarried. Upon my head the gods
have poured their wrath. Even the gentle Balder,
lover of all mankind, spurns my prayers. &rsquo;Twas
I who burned his temple. &lsquo;Wolf in the Sanctuary,&rsquo;
am I called. All joy ceases when my name
is spoken. The child clings trembling to its father&rsquo;s
knees. Once more will I seek the broad, free
ocean, whither earth and man have banished me.
Out, out, my dragon! Too long in idleness thou
hast lain. Again to the storm wind shalt thou
spread thy pinions, and bathe thy black breast in
the dashing spray! All&mdash;all on earth is lost to me
forever; the tempest&rsquo;s roar, the clash of arms shall
whisper comfort to my soul once more! So will
I live, so will I fighting fall; and mounting then
to Odin&rsquo;s throne, the gods, appeased, shall speak
my pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of King Ring</span></h2>
<p>Pale on his throne sat the aged monarch,
for he felt his end approaching. Ingeborg,
trembling, stood beside him, and a circle
of silent warriors stood about the royal
pair. Sorrowfully Frithiof entered to say farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day for the last time do ye behold me,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;for the last time my foot doth tread the
soil of earth. Henceforth, till the Norns shall send
their summons the ocean&rsquo;s boundless wastes shall
be my home. Take back the ring round which
such memories cluster, Ingeborg; let it be a parting
token from me. And thou, O King, go not
with thy Queen by moonlight to the strand, nor
when the pale stars shine, for at your feet the waves
might chance to toss my bleaching bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Frithiof,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;such mournful
plaints become not men; in maids they may be
pardoned. For me the death song soundeth, not
for thee. &rsquo;Tis I must hence, not thou! Take
thou my realm and guard it well. Take Ingeborg
as thy wife, and be a father to my infant son. Ever
through life hath peace been dearest to me; well
have I loved to sit with friends about the board;
yet with a strong hand have I guarded throne
and honor, and cloven many a shield on sea and
land; nor ever hath man seen my cheek turn pale.
Victory hath been mine, and glory. One boon only
have the gods denied me&mdash;to mount to Valhalla
from the battle-field. Death by the sword is the
death of heroes; to linger on,&mdash;the straw death,&mdash;never
such will Ring live to endure!&rdquo; And therewith
he plunged his sword into his breast. As the
life-blood gushed forth he had his horn brought to
him, and raising it aloft, with glowing face he
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thy glory I drain this, my country, thou
Northland! Ye gods of Valhalla, all hail, all
hail!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>KING RING&rsquo;S Death</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Silence reigned within the hall; none gave way
to grief lest the dying man&rsquo;s last moments should
be saddened. Sinking back on his cushions, the
King clasped Ingeborg&rsquo;s hand for the last time&mdash;greeted
his friend and son with a parting glance, and
sighing, his soul ascended to the All-Father. Great
was the mourning for him throughout the kingdom;
amid universal lamentations the good King&rsquo;s mound
was heaped above him, while scalds with sounding
dirges glorified his memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Election to the Kingdom</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;To the Ting! To the Ting!&rdquo; The
message flies o&rsquo;er hill and vale; the people
are summoned to elect their King.
Champions try their swords, vassals
polish their lord&rsquo;s helm and buckler till they shine
like the sun. Thus with clang of arms the warriors
assembled on the open plain. In their midst on
the wide Ting-stone stood Frithiof, and at his side
King Ring&rsquo;s son, a fair child with golden hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too young is Ring&rsquo;s heir,&rdquo; was murmured
through the multitude; &ldquo;no chief is he to lead us
into battle, or sit in judgment on the Ting-stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Frithiof placed the child upon his shield and
held him high aloft, saying: &ldquo;Northmen, behold
your King, a vigorous offshoot of the fallen oak!
Doth he not bear him well upon the shield? Hear
now my vow: I swear to guard for him his Kingdom,
till with his father&rsquo;s circlet he shall one day
here be crowned.&rdquo; Then raising his eyes to heaven,
he added: &ldquo;Forsete, son of Balder, be my witness!
O thou who judgest justly, strike me dead if e&rsquo;er
I break my word!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Meanwhile the King&rsquo;s son sat on Frithiof&rsquo;s gleaming
shield, gazing about him proudly; but at length
he began to weary of it, and with one bound sprang
lightly to the ground. A shout went up from all
the Ting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, that was indeed a royal leap! Aye, shield-borne,
thee we choose to be our King! And thou,
O Frithiof, who shalt guard his crown and kingdom,
take Ingeborg, our Queen, to be thy wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Frithiof&rsquo;s brow darkened. &ldquo;To
choose a King are you come,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;my
bride I woo of my own choice. In anger still doth
Balder look upon me. &rsquo;Twas he that took my
Ingeborg from me, and he alone can give her back
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Reconciliation</span></h2>
<p>No peace was there yet in Frithiof&rsquo;s heart.
As fire had once consumed the temple,
so within him still blazed the flames of
his remorse that by his act had Balder&rsquo;s
earthly dwelling been destroyed. Betaking himself
to his father&rsquo;s grave-mound he sat all night alone
upon the cairn, beseeching Balder to smile upon
him once again. And lo! in the darkness a wondrous
vision grew before his eyes. In Balder&rsquo;s Grove
he saw a gleaming temple slowly rise; but scarcely
had he gazed upon it in amazement, when again
&rsquo;twas swallowed in the gloom of night.</p>
<p>Roused by fresh hope of winning the offended
god&rsquo;s forgiveness, he hastily returned to Ring&rsquo;s
dominions and summoned architects to plan for the
building of a new temple. Just as he had seen it in
his vision should the home of Balder actually rise.
So filled was he with this one thought that nothing
else had power to move him, neither feast, nor chase,
nor sounding minstrel lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>At last the work was finished, and like the far-famed
shrine of Upsal, the great temple stood a
wonder to all eyes. A brazen portal richly carved
led to the sanctuary; two rows of lofty columns
supported the arching roof, like a great shield of
gold. Facing the doorway stood the high altar,
hewn from a single block of Northern marble and
polished with rare skill; round about it were graven
runes of solemn import. Above, in a spacious
niche, was Balder&rsquo;s august image, wrought all of
purest silver. On a rocky hillside rose the building,
its reflection mirrored in the sea below, while
round about on three sides stretched a smiling
valley, known as Balder&rsquo;s Dale. Leafy groves
adorned the flowery meadows. No sound but happy
bird songs broke the silence; all nature breathed of
peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>With deep emotion Frithiof trod those holy precincts.
Twelve rosy-cheeked maidens, priestesses
of the temple, robed all in white, advanced to the
high altar and chanted a holy song in praise of
Balder. They sang how beloved was the gentle god
by every creature; and when he fell by evil Loke&rsquo;s
malice, how heaven itself with earth and ocean wept.
And as leaning on his sword the hero listened, the
dark shadow, that so long had lain upon his spirit,
lifted. Tender memories of his childhood woke
within him, while calm and serene as the moon in
the skies of Summer, Balder the Good looked down
upon him and filled his soul with peace. Then
with slow steps approached the high-priest of the
temple, not young and fair like the god at whose
shrine he worshipped, but tall and majestic, his
noble features stamped with heavenly mildness
and graced with flowing beard and locks of silver.
With unwonted reverence Frithiof bent his haughty
head before the seer, who thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, son Frithiof, to this holy temple.
Long have I looked for thee to come, for force,
though restless over land and sea it wanders, turns
ever, wearied, home again at last. Oft did the
mighty Thor wend thus to J&ouml;tunheim, the giants&rsquo;
kingdom; yet despite his godlike belt and magic
gauntlets, the giant King still sits upon his throne.
Evil, itself a force, yields not to evil. Virtue without
strength is but child&rsquo;s play, the glancing sunbeam
on the shield, a wavering shadow on the earth&rsquo;s
broad breast. Yet neither may strength without
virtue long survive. It consumes itself, like rusting
sword in some dark grave-mound&mdash;a debauch
from which he who yieldeth to it wakens filled with
shame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the mighty earth! It is the body of
Ymir, the world-giant from whom all strength proceeds&mdash;its
rushing streams his blue veins; its iron
and brass his sinews; yet all is barren, bare, and
empty till heaven&rsquo;s bright sun-rays stream upon it
from afar. Then springs the grass; fair blossoms
deck the verdant meadows, and fresh leaves, the
trees; the swelling buds burst forth; all nature
breathes new life from the abundant earth. Thus
is it with man&rsquo;s strength: it yields naught but blessing
when transfigured by the heavenly rays of virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the sun is to the earth, was Balder to Valhalla.
His pure soul was the gem that fastened the
wreath divine. When, slain by evil Loke, he descended
to pale Hel&rsquo;s realm, Odin&rsquo;s wisdom straight
began to languish, and the strength of mighty Thor
to dwindle; the prisoned forces of evil, once mastered
by the gods, stirred in their abysses; the
dragon Nidh&ouml;gg gnawed at the roots of the Tree of
Life, and its leafy crown fast withered. Again the
war broke out &rsquo;twixt good and evil&mdash;the strife that
through all creation still endures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is but the emblem of what passes in every
human breast. Hast thou forgotten, my son, those
days when Balder dwelt within thy spirit? Pure
then was every thought and feeling, thy whole life
glad as a woodland songster&rsquo;s dream. In every
child does Balder reappear; in each that is born
doth Hel restore her victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in each soul is also found the blind god
H&ouml;der. Evil is ever born blind, like the bear-cub;
in darkness it enwraps itself, while good goes clad
in shining robes of light. Loke still creepeth busily
about to guide the hand of murder; with Balder
dies the strength of heart and spirit, and anew the
struggle in man&rsquo;s breast begins. Virtue sits hopeless
mid the shadows, as the fair god in the darkness
of the underworld.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;So hath it been with thee, Frithiof. Passion
and thirst for vengeance rose within thee, and Balder&rsquo;s
temple sank to earth in ashes. Now thou
seekest atonement; but knowest thou its meaning
rightly? Nay, boldly meet my gaze and turn not
pale, O youth! But one atoner is there on our
earth&mdash;his name is Death. All time itself is but a
troubled stream from vast eternity; atonement came
from the All-Father&rsquo;s throne to restore us thither
purified. The high gods, too, have sinned. Their
day of battle, the Twilight of the Gods, is their
atonement, and from their fall a higher life shall
rise. Ah, bloody is the day that sees their strife
with the powers of evil! The golden-combed cock
that sits on Odin&rsquo;s golden palace doth shrilly call to
arms. Bursting his chains, up springs the giant
wolf from the abyss; the earth-enveloping serpent
writhes in fury; boiling and foaming, the sea o&rsquo;erflows
the land; the whole earth shakes; mountains
crash together; the Tree of Life groans and trembles;
in terror flee the shades that hover about
the path of the dead. On the corpse-ship, made
from the nails of the unburied dead, Loke, the wolf
Fenris, and the giant Hrymer ride to join the battle.
On come the flame giants, their swords gleaming
like the red glow of the forge. Over the rainbow
bridge they gallop&mdash;with a frightful crash it breaks
beneath their horses&rsquo; tread; the heavens are rent
asunder; thunder peals sound from pole to pole;
the shouts of terrified mortals mingle with the groans
of the dwarfs, who, pale and trembling, cower in
their rocky caverns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;But already have the gods and heroes donned
their shining armor, and, led by Odin, crowned
with his golden circlet and shaking aloft his gleaming
spear, over Vigrid&rsquo;s boundless plain they move
in mighty train. There arrayed against each other
stand the hosts, and the strife begins. Spears hiss,
swords clash, the battle-cries of gods and giants fill
the air; the furious bellowing of the serpent and
the howling of Fenris shake the dome of heaven.
One by one the gods are slain; but not unavenged
do they perish, for the powers of evil also fall to rise
no more, while from the flames of the world they
rise to higher life. Aye, though the stars fall from
the heavens and the earth is buried deep beneath
the waves, yet newly born, the abode of man once
more arises from the waters; a new sun shines on
smiling mead and golden harvest. Then shall those
golden runic tablets, lost in Time&rsquo;s far dawning and
graven with the wisdom of the gods, again be found
amid the springing grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struggle and death are but the fiery proof of virtue;
atonement another birth to higher life. The
best, the happiest part of our existence, lies beyond
the grave-mound; low and deep-stained with guilt
and error is all we find &rsquo;neath heaven&rsquo;s starlit dome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;This life, too, hath its atonement&mdash;dim type
of that still higher yet to come. Earth is but
Heaven&rsquo;s shadow; human life the outer court of
Balder&rsquo;s heavenly temple. Decked with purple is
the proud steed led to sacrifice&mdash;a symbol, rightly
read, that blood is the red dawn of every day of
grace. Yet by the sacrifice of no other may thine
own guilt be redeemed. The wrongs that man
commits he must himself atone for. The sacrifice
All-Father demands from thee, more sweet to him
than blood and reek of victim, is thy fierce hate and
burning vengeance offered on the altar of thy heart.
If thou slay not these, then little will this proud
arched temple serve thee. Not with piled-up stones
mayst thou atone to Balder. First with thyself and
with thy foe be reconciled; then, Frithiof, shalt thou
have the bright god&rsquo;s pardon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear now, what wondrous news hath reached
us from the South: there, so &rsquo;tis said, was a new
Balder, born of a pure Virgin, sent by the great All-Father
to lead man to atonement. Peace was his
war-cry; his bright sword, Love; crowning his helm,
the dove of Innocence. Pure was his life and pure
were his teachings; dying, he forgave. Palms wave
above his far-off grave, but still his teachings spread
from vale to vale, melting hard hearts, joining hand
to hand, upraising such a realm of Peace as never
yet was seen upon the earth. But little know I of
this creed, alas! yet oft in better moments dimly I
gaze upon its streaming light, and loud my heart
proclaims to me the time will come when it shall
also spread through all the North. Levelled then
will be our grave-mounds; lost in the stream of
time our names, while other men shall flourish, other
chieftains reign. Ye happier race, who then shall
drink from the New Light&rsquo;s shining goblet, I greet
ye in the spirit. Hail! all hail! Despise us not
whose eager gaze hath ceaselessly sought the radiant
light of Heaven! Scorn not those to whom the
divine ray was still wrapped in veiling shadows!
The All-Father hath many envoys&mdash;He Himself
is One!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frithiof, thou hatest Bele&rsquo;s sons; but wherefore?
Because, proud of their descent from Seming,
Odin&rsquo;s royal offspring, they did refuse their sister&rsquo;s
hand to thee. But &lsquo;birth is chance,&rsquo; thou sayst, &lsquo;not
merit.&rsquo; Know, my son, man ever boasts of fortune,
not of merit. Thou art proud of thy strength and
of thy glorious deeds; but didst thou give thyself
this force? Was it not Thor who strung thy sinewy
arm firm as the oak limb? Is it not God-sprung
courage that throbs so joyously within thy breast?
Beside thy cradle the Norns sang hero-songs to thee.
Thus are thy noblest gifts no merit, but thy fortune,&mdash;of
no more worth than that of which the princes boast.
Condemn not, judge not, others&rsquo; pride,&mdash;then none
will judge thine own. King Helge is no more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Helge dead!&rdquo; cried Frithiof, starting.
&ldquo;Where and how came he to his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While thou,&rdquo; continued the high priest, &ldquo;wert
building here this temple, he, as thou knowest, did
undertake a foray &rsquo;gainst the Finns. Within their
borders, on a barren mountain-peak there stood an
ancient temple of the heathen Jumala. It was closed
and abandoned, and none for many years had ever
crossed its threshold. Above the portal, tottering
to its fall as it appeared, was placed an idol of the
god, and an old tradition handed down from sire to
sire said, whoever first should enter in the temple
should Jumala behold. No sooner did Helge hear
this than, blind with rage, he scaled the barren steep,
bent on destroying the hated deity&rsquo;s abode. He
found the key still in the door, thick covered o&rsquo;er
with rust. Grasping the moss-grown posts he shook
them fiercely, and thereupon, with tremendous crash,
down plunged the image of the heathen god; and
thus did Helge view the dreaded Jumala.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now Halfdan rules alone. Give him thy hand,
brave Frithiof. Sacrifice thy hatred in this holy
shrine. Thus saith Balder, and I his high priest
this demand of thee. Refuse, and vain will be thy
efforts to avert his godlike wrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Halfdan entered through the doorway and
with doubtful glance lingered on the threshold of the
temple. But Frithiof unbuckled Angurvadel from
his side and placed it with his shield against the altar.
Unarmed he approached his enemy and said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this strife he is noblest who first doth offer
his hand in pledge of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flushing deeply, Halfdan doffed his iron gauntlet,
and with a firm hand-clasp the two heroes sealed their
reconciliation. Now the high priest removed the curse
that had rested on Frithiof since the burning of the
temple, and as he joyfully raised his head, no longer
an outlaw, lo! Ingeborg entered, radiant in her bridal
garments and robed in royal ermine. With tears in
her beautiful eyes, she sank trembling in her brother&rsquo;s
arms, but Halfdan tenderly transferred his burden to
Frithiof&rsquo;s faithful breast; and kneeling before the
altar of the pardoning Balder, with joined hands the
long-parted lovers sealed their nuptial vows.</p>

<p class="revint"><i>A new, interesting, and very useful series that will be found especially

<p class="tb">The books in this series are translated from the German, because
in that country a specialty is made of really desirable
reading for the young. Sixteen titles are now ready and more will

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
